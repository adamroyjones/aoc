* 2023
This directory contains some attempts at solutions to the 2023 Advent of Code
problems. I chose Janet (v1.32.1) as my language of choice.

** Why Janet?
I don't yet know the language, but it has some appealing properties.

- It can be compiled and distributed.
- It has a minimal startup time.
- It can be embedded.
- It's small.
- It's ergonomic (e.g., it comes with threading macros).
- It has built-in support for parsing expression grammars.
- Some lovely people created [[https://github.com/andrewchambers/janetsh][sh]] and [[https://github.com/ianthehenry/cmd][cmd]].

It has the potential to displace my use of Bash and Ruby, but it's only through
use that this can be determined.
